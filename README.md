Hi! welcome to my tests performed while following Adrian Rosebrock's pyimagegurus_course

On several cases I changed or tried different stuff to validate the concepts. 

Basic stuff runs on notebooks they are good to tell a story with snippets in between.  These Jupyter notebooks were tuned to work on VSCODE. I found VSC to have problems with the cv2 cv2.show('mypic', mypic) so i moved to matplotlib function, which required a color space translation.
